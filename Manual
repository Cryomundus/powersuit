UAC Light Powersuit, "Mongoose"

================================
INFO
================================

Contrary to the name, and to both the disappointment and glee of infantry, the Mongoose is not a suit
of power armor, but rather more like a pocket-sized mech. With a modular gun mount on each arm,
the Mongoose brings enough firepower to easily plow through all of the demons commonly encountered
by infantry units. Along with using the same armor plates found in battle armor, and using
systems that can be easily replaced, the Mongoose is incredibly versatile and easy to maintain.
However, it is still a mech, and as a result is not nearly as agile as being on-foot.

================================
SPAWNING
================================

The Mongoose has a chance to replace megaspheres. They will spawn a beacon along with two weapons
- one of them is always a 4mm LMG, but the other one is random. Activate the beacon in your
inventory in order to teleport in a Mongoose.

================================
IMPORTANT CONTROLS
================================

Press use on the powersuit to get in.
Press crouch + use while inside the powersuit to get out.
Press crouch + use on the powersuit, while outside, to open up the maintenance menu. Alternatively,
if someone is inside the powersuit already, this will eject them.
Press use item while selecting a powersuit weapon in order to be able to reload / unload it
without attaching it to the powersuit.

Holding use will bring up controls for everything else. This applies for both the control
interface and the maintenance screen. Note that on the maintenance screen, the controls will
change depending on context, so make sure to check the controls on every option!

================================
MECHANICS
================================

The powersuit uses tank controls - left and right will turn the legs left and right, rather than
strafing. The torso can rotate independently, however--basically, it's like mechwarrior.

Left click will fire the left arm, while right click will fire the right arm. The places they're
aiming is represented by the cyan reticle and purple reticle, respectively. They'll try to
converge on where you're looking. There's no way to tell whether reticle is in front of or behind
of an object, so be aware of that.

When struck by fire, such as from an imp, the powersuit will gain heat. If it gets hot enough, 
you'll start taking damage. While not inside the powersuit, you can tell if it's still beyond 
this threshold if it is smoking. The powersuit, unfortunately, does not protect very well against 
mancubus/combat slug flamethrowers.

The powersuit has a battery life of 30 minutes, with 15 minutes for each battery. The shields
only have a battery life of 10 minutes while idle, and drain significantly faster when recharging.

Should there be a place you simply can't get the powersuit through, you can disassemble the suit
and transport each of the parts to the destination. In order to place the suit, simply use the
torso inventory item. Note that the limbs can only be dropped from the item manager (press
the mag manager button twice in a row).
